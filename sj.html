<h2>South Jeolla Province or Jeollanam-do (Korean pronunciation: [tɕʌl.la.nam.do]) is a province in the southwest of South Korea. The province was formed in 1896 from the southern half of the former Jeolla province, remained a province of Korea until the country's division in 1945, then became part of South Korea. Gwangju was the capital of the province, until the provincial office moved to the southern village of Namak, Muan County in 2005.</h2>
